                                John's Gardening Goods was founded in 1948 when an 18 year-old John Roenitz was working at an Army surplus store in Binghamton, New York. An avid fisherman,
                                John was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After John presented his suggestions,
                                the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. John was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot
                                of time as a kid and told her what had happened. John's grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. John said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went
                                to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him “do it yourself.” John used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton.
                                By the late 1970's, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at John’s Garden Goods today.</p>
