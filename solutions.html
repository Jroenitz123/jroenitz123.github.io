activities for its various departments and store formats. They also were struggling to keep stores up-to-date and use a variety of communication methods, including email, phone, and 
intranet.To address these issues, John's LIS Gardening store implemented Reflexis Task Managerâ„¢ retail store execution platform. With the
 solution, they were able to streamline communications, monitor task completion and compliance levels, and create a two-way 
 communication between corporate and stores so that stores could provide feedback. </p>
